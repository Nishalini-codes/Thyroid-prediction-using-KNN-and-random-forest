# Thyroid Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

Thyroid disease is a growing concern in India, affecting millions each year. These disorders can accelerate or decelerate the body’s metabolism and lead to serious health complications if left undiagnosed.

This project is based on my original research work, also published in an academic paper. It aims to detect different types of thyroid disorders using machine learning models trained on the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset. The focus is on classifying whether a patient has:
- Compensated Hypothyroid
- Primary Hypothyroid
- Secondary Hypothyroid
- Or is Negative (no thyroid disease)

### 🔍 Research Highlights
- Conducted extensive data preprocessing and modeling
- Hyperparameter tuning applied for optimized performance
- XGBoost model outperformed others based on precision, recall, and accuracy
- Project deployed on both Heroku and AWS using Flask framework

> 📌 **Note**: This work extends publicly available projects but includes significant modifications and original contributions as part of a formal research publication.
